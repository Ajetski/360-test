Run a server that serves a static site.

You may use any server of your choice, but I will provide instructions for the one I use below.

- Download and Install Node.js

- run `npm i -g http-server` to install the server

- run `http-server -p 5000` to start the server (while the terminal is in the working directory of the project)

- go to localhost:5000/ in a web browser to use the site.
